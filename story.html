Greetings...
A story of a true king has begun with the phenomenon of knowing what he went through and what he choose after being pushed into the ground of loss by those who called him friends and by those who were his family ' 
He who is known as the true king took an oath to get up and grow from the scratch as he was betrayed as he was back stabbed as he was killed through a sharp tactic of betrayal's 
True King started in kingdom 1570 with his good friends with a dream of making new friends and with a dream and aim of becoming the ZavTsar he was mean't to be but there's a twist that would change his mindset of making friends
• they started as usual a new alliance with progress of growth and strategies' the taking of lands with flags and the aim to take our first sanctum and suddenly they saw a huge amount of scouts running towards their flags and then we saw huge amount of t3s rushing towards our hard grown small cities we had no chance 
• experience against power our leader motivated all those who were frightened who were scared and were ready to run away ' we stood no chance to win'
• As the french armies marched towards us we did our best to stand our ground and tackle big looses we had a good warlord with a heavy rally ' we all pushed off our stocks and marched towards our ally and filled his rallies simultaneously '
• it was a good battle of 2 days then a good friendly chinese alliance summones upon us and did what was right a proposal of allyship and without any reconsideration we accepted their proposal and we were increased in power and armies
• we won the next hour without any more struggling we took sanctums and did good friendly wars and we were having fun ' the chinese alliance was powerful they were aligned with a single icon and they all had the same leader and plans to follow 
• after a good month of playing rise of kingdom we were playing mightiest governor with our chinese allies we had good field fights but as ZavTsar(True King) went offline he recieved a mail that our flags are under attack'''
• we were shocked and we were facing way more bigger threat then ever ' a friendly ally attacking us with their 11million whale ' we almost lost ' when ever the chinese alliance went to sleep we had a chance to rebuild and take small steps forward
Next part soon
